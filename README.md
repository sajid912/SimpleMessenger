Establish communication between distributed devices across a network

The project focuses on establishing communication between devices across a network.

We use Android framework for establishing a virtual network between emulators. 
Emulators simulate the behavior of distributed devices across the internet.

Both one way and two way communication between the emulators is tested in this project.
